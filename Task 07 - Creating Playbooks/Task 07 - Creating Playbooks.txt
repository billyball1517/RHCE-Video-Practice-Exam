- Create a playbook to set up ansible1.example.com as a web server.
  Use another playbook to install wget and elinks on ansible2 and ansible3.
  For the playbooks, use the following instructions:
    - Create a host group webservers and a host group webclients to run the playbooks on the appropriate hosts.
    - Provide a sample vhost.conf file as a Jinja2 template.
      Copy it to the web/templates directory and ensure it is copied to all web servers.
      Use variables and/or facts to ensure the local hostname is used in the name of the vhost file, as well as all references to the local host.
    - Define the following variables and use them while setting up the web servers:
        - web_package       httpd
        - web_service       httpd
        - web_config_file   /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
        - firewall_service  httpd
    - Ensure that the web server package is installed
    - Ensure that the service is enabled and started
    - Open a port in the firewalld firewall
    - Copy the httpd.conf template file, using the following properties:
        - owner: root
        - group: root
        - permission mode: 0644
        - SELinux context: httpd_config_t
    - Use a handler to restart the web server after copying the configuration file
    - Create a playbook that sets up the web-client machines and installs curl and wget on them
    - Create a generic playbook with the name "web" which you can use to run both playbooks by using includes or imports
