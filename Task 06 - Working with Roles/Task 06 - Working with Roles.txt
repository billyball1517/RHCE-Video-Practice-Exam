- Create a custom role to configure SSH. Make sure that it contains the following elements:
    - A template file for the sshd_config, where the SSH port, AllowedUsers, and PermitRoot parameters are managed through variables (which must be set when calling the role from the playbook)
- Create a playbook that calls the role. Before calling the role, the playbook should ensure that SELinux is in enforcing state.
  Further, the playbook must define variables to set the SSH port to 2022, and AllowedUsers to the user Ansible.
- Ensure the role is only called when the OS family is set to RedHat
- Also ensure that the firewall is opened, and the appropriate SELinux context is set on the port
