Task 1: Setting up Inventory
- Configure the control host with a static inventory, as well as the ansible.cfg configuration file. In the static inventory, configure the following host groups.
    - Group test with ansible1.example.com as a member
    - Group dev with ansible2.example.com as a member
    - Group prod with ansible3 and ansible4 as a member
    - A group servers, with groups dev and prod as a member
    - Ensure that hosts can be reached through their FQDN, but also by using the short name (so: ansible1.example.com as well as ansible1)
